# CamelLab

In this Lab I'm testing Apache Camel as a Content Orchestrator for handling the acquisition of new items. Key aspects to proof:
* Modeling and Implementation of Enterprise Integration Patterns
* Instances Tracking and Monitoring
* Workflow improvement: Velocity and TTM

git clone https://github.com/garciapau/CamelLab.git
cd CamelLab
mvn compile exec:java

Note: In order to easily access the Hawtio console, you can disable the authentication by adding the following property to the JVM: "-Dhawtio.authenticationEnabled=false"
